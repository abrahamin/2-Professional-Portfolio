# 2-Professional-Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a web application from scratch showcasing a portfolio page, designed to display examples of my deployed work and the thought processes behind their construction. In doing so, the product will serve to aid in my career search and in receiving attention as a potential candidate from tech companies.

The core skills utilized in the creation of this portfolio include flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. As I continue to learn more languages and skill sets and develop additional web applications, improvements to this portfolio will be possible.

In order to meet the Acceptance Criteria of the project:
* my name, a recent photo, and navigation links to sections of the web application are present
* a section with titled images of my work allows the viewer to access the deployed application upon click
* resizing the page or viewing the site via mobile devices will be accounted for by a responsive layout
